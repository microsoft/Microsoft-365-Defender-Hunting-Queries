// Query for links opened from mail apps – if a detection occurred right afterwards.
// As there are many links opened from mails, to have a successful hunt we should have some filter or join with some other signal,
// such as suspicious processes, network connections, etc.
// Therefore, in this example, we query for alerts that might be related to links sent via email.
// This could be indicative of a phishing or spear-phishing attacks.

// Explaining the underlying data:
//     This query uses the BrowserLaunchedToOpenUrl event, that includes clicks on http:// or https:// links (clicks outside of browsers), or on .lnk files
//     For this event, RemoteUrl contains the opened URL.
